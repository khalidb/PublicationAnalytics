Agile course example
=====================

You can download the Java project by pressing the ZIP button on top of the page. 

The project contains three folders. 2 source folders named "src" and "test", and 
a third folder called "lib", which contains the java library necessary for accessing and 
querying XML using XQuery [1].

The Java class in the folder "src" has a Java class that contains the methods for 
computing the mean number of author appearances per publication. Specifically, it 
contains three methods, the first for computing the total number of publication, 
the second for calculating the total number of author appearances, and the last 
compute the mean using teh above two methods. For each method m, you will find three 
versions, names mA, mB and mC. These reflects the changes that were made following teh test
in the Java class in the "test" folder.
